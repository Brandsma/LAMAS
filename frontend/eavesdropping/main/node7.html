<LI>Concerning Bob's accessibility relations: Once he has received a key, he would not know <SPAN  CLASS="textit">whose</SPAN> key it is, but he would be able to distinguish that key from another key if he were to be confronted with both simultaneously.  Thus we think his accessibility relations across keys drops as soon as he receives a key.  This, however, does not express his false belief concerning the origin of the key.  Should we simply include this additional belief formalism in natural language or perhaps make a separate kripke structure just for key ownership?
</LI>
<LI>For the next step, how might model the fact that Alice and Bob become aware of their being eavesdropped on (in terms of formalism)?  Again, this seems like a separate realm of knowledge than the kripke structures for the actual communication protocol.  Should we make separate structures and formalism for that as well?
</LI>
<LI>Thank you for the help!! We are quite excited about this project :D
