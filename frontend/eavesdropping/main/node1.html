<P>
Communication is the act of exchanging information.  From complex webs of exchange to simple binary patterns, the core principle remains the same&ndash;information is transferred between agents.  What then becomes of this information?  There are two ways an agent may interact with information, namely through knowledge or belief.  Communication therefore becomes an instance of dynamic epistemology, whereby knowledge and beliefs of agents are changed over time through the dynamic exchange of information that is communication.  Here, three scenarios of increasingly complex communication are modelled and formalized: perfect communication, perfect communication with eavesdropping, and the "interlocks" protocol, as described in [<A
 HREF="node12.html#main">1</A>].  Along with a brief introduction here, each communication configuration will be simulated in the spirit of the [<A
 HREF="node12.html#lockwebjs">2</A>] page, and presenting with the appropriate formalism page, line here cyan[links].

<P>
In its most distilled form, communication may be imagined as a simple binary constellation of two agents wherein bits of information are exchanged.  If Alice sends Bob a bit <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE=""
 SRC="img1.svg"
 ALT="$p$"></SPAN>, then Bob definitely receives it and therefore Bob <SPAN  CLASS="textit">knows</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE=""
 SRC="img1.svg"
 ALT="$p$"></SPAN>.  This idealized communication, free from deletion error or interference, may be thought of as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">perfect communication.</SPAN>  A more realistic protocol for this sort of exchange involves first the exchange of public keys that are unique to each agent (and their respective private keys).  Then <SPAN  CLASS="textit">cypertexts</SPAN> can be encrypted with the opposite agent's public key, so that they may open it with their private key upon reception.  This method is a predecessor to more advanced encryption protocols cyan[see encryption methods section] and may presently stand in for baseline communication.

<P>
As secure as the above protocol may seem, it can be shown to be vulnerable to an eavesdropping agent who may intercept and copy the public keys and instead pass along their own public key that has its own corresponding private key.  Therefore, when information is passed, this intermediary agent may decrypt a message with its own private key and re-encrypt it with the correct public key for the recipient agent to receive and decrypt none-the-wiser.  

<P>
The first order of defense against this sort of eavesdropping is of course awareness and therefore, the &ldquo;interlocks" protocol [<A
 HREF="node12.html#main">1</A>] is too presented.  This method employs a partitioning strategy which cuts cyphertexts in half and cyanmixes them together, rendering them useless on their own.  They are then sent in two parts.  The previous eavesdropping scheme thus fails, as both halves are needed to make sense of the message and the intercepting agents cannot decrypt and re-encrypt passing messages successfully without revealing itself, because the receiving agents will get a garbled message if the eavedropper has done this.  Once known, the communicating agents will know to switch to another line of communication.

<P>
In total, it can be seen that perfect communication is susceptible to eavesdropping and that the interlocks protocol is sufficient to reveal if a line of communication is indeed being listened to.  With this knowledge, communicating agents can simply switch to another means of communication and thus the problem is solved.
